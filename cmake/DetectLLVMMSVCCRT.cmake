#[=======================================================================[.rst:
Module for detect which Windows CRT LLVM was built against, and use that for
our ComputeAorta builds.

Works by querying the CRT that was used to build ``LLVMCore.lib``, and then
set our CRT to be the same as the one LLVM used. Allowing us to mix build
types from LLVM/ComputeAorta.

.. important::
  This module is guarded with a check for ``MSVC`` so it only applies to
  Windows builds.
#]=======================================================================]

# If we are compiling with MSVC we detect the CRT LLVM was built for.
if(NOT MSVC)
